# Recipe hub

"A place to create, share, collect, and annotate recipes with the world."

When I cook, I never follow a recipe exactly. In fact, I make similar adjustments every time.
I believe recipes should be personal, living documents, perhaps originating from another cook, but changing to reflect my own creations.

### Features
The core idea of Recipe hub is to be able to `fork` a good recipe you like, and make it your own. Others can `fork` your recipe if they like, and make it their own. If you want to follow a recipe of another cook, you can simply `star` it, too.

Popular recipes will have lots of `stars`, indicating they're a really great recipe, and lots of `forks`, indicating they're often used as the foundation for another's recipe.

Users of Recipe hub can...
- Duplicate (fork) a recipe for personal modifications.
- Star a recipe to keep it in your recipe book.
- Create and modify recipes quickly using an interactive form.
- Search for recipes by title and by tag
- Find all recipes with matching tags
